# ORLA
Welcome to the Github repository for ORLA.

I have provided most of the source code for my bot so you can see how I did things. Feel free to browse my bot to learn how I did certain things. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me on Discord: **Fin#1234**.

NOTE: This is not the live build of the bot. Current live features will be added to this version in time, and eventually this will be the live build, but until then, this is purely for testing purposes and the bot itself is limited to a server only for developers.
